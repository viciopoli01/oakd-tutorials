    "In these exercises, you will learn how to integrate the [OAK-D device](https://store.opencv.ai/products/oak-d) from OpenCV's AI Kit with your Duckiebot, replacing the Duckiebot's Raspberry Pi camera with the camera system of OAK-D. Using the OAK-D, you are able to offload many computational tasks from your Duckiebot to this powerful embedded device such as stereo vision, machine learning inference, and image processing/manipulation. Get ready, because these features will bring your robotic system to the next level!"
